## Adding/Creating Your Own Custom Items
You can use [this](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge-Item-Json-Generator) tool to generate item data for Ore Forge and to manage the Items that you have created so far. Make sure you read its README so ou know how items
work!

Once you've created your item the script should add it automatically to the correct directory. 
### Key Components:
* The [GameWorld](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/blob/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Screens/GameWorld.java) class is where the game is rendered and the game logic is driven from.
* Under the [Strategies Folder](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/tree/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Strategies) you can find the classes that are responsible upgrade logic and effect logic.
* The [Ore](https://github.com/NathanUlmen/OreForge/blob/main/core/src/main/java/ore/forge/Ore.java) class is pretty important as it's what the game revolves around.
