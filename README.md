## What is Ore Forge?

In Ore Forge you assemble your tycoon out of 4 item types, each of which have tons of unique variants,
__*Droppers, Conveyors, Upgraders,*__ and __*Furnaces*__. Droppers generate/produce ore which is transported through
your
custom-built tycoon of conveyors and upgraders. As the ore moves through your tycoon each upgrader upgrades it,
increasing its value. Finally, the ore is delivered to a furnace where it is sold, often applying a bonus to the ore,
earning you cash.
This cash can be used purchase items from the shop or to prestige, granting you a random prestige tier item to use in
your tycoon.
